# `deposit` Function Can Be Called Multiple Times

## Finding description and impact

The `deposit` function allows the contract owner to deposit `titn` tokens, but it does not check whether `TITN_ARB` has already been deposited.


The owner can deposit the same amount multiple times, which could break logic relying on `totalTitnClaimable`.
If this function is called more than once, the balance of `titn` in the contract could be artificially inflated.


## Proof of Concept
https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-02-thorwallet/blob/98d7e936518ebd80e2029d782ffe763a3732a792/contracts/MergeTgt.sol#L44-L56

```solidity
    function deposit(IERC20 token, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        if (token != titn) {
            revert InvalidTokenReceived();
        }

        // enforce that the deposited amount is 12_500_000 * 10**18
        if (amount != TITN_ARB) {
            revert InvalidAmountReceived();
        }

        token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        emit Deposit(address(token), amount);
    }
```
Hereâ€™s how the function can be exploited:

1. The owner calls `deposit` with `TITN_ARB` tokens:
   ```solidity
   deposit(titn, TITN_ARB);
   ```
   This transfers `TITN_ARB` tokens to the contract and emits a `Deposit` event.

2. The owner calls `deposit` again with the same parameters:
   ```solidity
   deposit(titn, TITN_ARB);
   ```
   This transfers another `TITN_ARB` tokens to the contract, even though the contract may not be designed to handle multiple deposits.

3. This process can be repeated indefinitely, as long as the owner has sufficient `TITN` tokens to deposit.


## Recommended mitigation steps

Introduce a boolean flag to ensure `deposit()` is only called once:
