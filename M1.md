# Reentrancy Vulnerability in withdrawRemainingTitn

## Finding description and impact

Impact: Potential double-spending of tokens if reentrancy attacks are successfully executed.

Details: The withdrawRemainingTitn function transfers TITN tokens to the user before updating the state variables (claimableTitnPerUser, totalTitnClaimed, etc.). This violates the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern and could allow a reentrancy attack if TITN is a malicious ERC20 token with a transfer hook.

## Proof of Concept


    Deploy a malicious ERC20 token with a transfer hook that calls withdrawRemainingTitn again.
    Call withdrawRemainingTitn to exploit the reentrancy vulnerability.

#
The function withdrawRemainingTitn is not properly secured against reentrancy attacks. Even though nonReentrant is used, the logic updates state variables after token transfers, which is dangerous.

#
Problematic code
```solidity
titn.safeTransfer(msg.sender, titnOut);

emit WithdrawRemainingTitn(msg.sender, titnOut);
```
Since the transfer happens before updating claimableTitnPerUser[msg.sender], an attacker could attempt reentrancy via fallback functions.

## Recommended mitigation steps

    Follow the CEI pattern by updating state variables before transferring tokens.
