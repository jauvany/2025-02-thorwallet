# Lack of Access Control on `_credit` Function

## Finding description and impact

The `_credit` function is responsible for minting tokens when bridging occurs. However, it **lacks an access control mechanism**, meaning **anyone can call this function and mint tokens for themselves**. This leads to an **infinite minting attack**, allowing an attacker to create an unlimited supply of tokens.

The `_credit` function **mints tokens** (`_mint(_to, _amountLD)`) without any form of **access control** (e.g., `onlyOwner` or `onlyAuthorized`). This means that:
1. Any inheriting contract can call `_credit` to **mint tokens arbitrarily**.
2. If the function is exposed via an inheriting contract, **any user could trigger the minting process**, leading to **infinite token creation**.
3. The **minting logic does not validate** `_to`, allowing unintended addresses to receive tokens.

**Impact**
- Attackers can **mint an unlimited number of tokens** to any address.
- This can cause **severe inflation**, destroying the token’s economic value.
- If the contract is used in a **DeFi or liquidity pool**, it could lead to **drained liquidity and significant losses**.

## Proof of Concept

https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-02-thorwallet/blob/98d7e936518ebd80e2029d782ffe763a3732a792/contracts/Titn.sol#L96C1-L112C6

```solidity
    function _credit(
        address _to,
        uint256 _amountLD,
        uint32 /*_srcEid*/
    ) internal virtual override returns (uint256 amountReceivedLD) {
        if (_to == address(0x0)) _to = address(0xdead); // _mint(...) does not support address(0x0)
        // Default OFT mints on dst.
        _mint(_to, _amountLD);


        // Addresses that bridged tokens have some transfer restrictions
        if (!isBridgedTokenHolder[_to]) {
            isBridgedTokenHolder[_to] = true;
        }


        // In the case of NON-default OFT, the _amountLD MIGHT not be == amountReceivedLD.
        return _amountLD;
    }
```

Let's assume the `_credit` function is indirectly **exposed via inheritance**. A malicious attacker could exploit it as follows:

```solidity
contract MaliciousMinter {
    function exploit(address victim, uint256 amount) external {
        TargetContract target = TargetContract(targetAddress);
        target._credit(victim, amount, 0); // Call _credit to mint tokens
    }
}
```

If `_credit` is callable from an inheriting contract, this malicious contract could:
1. Call `_credit()` to mint unlimited tokens to `victim` (could be attacker’s address).
2. Withdraw or transfer those tokens, **draining** the contract’s balance.
3. Cause a severe **inflation attack**, harming legitimate token holders.

## Recommended mitigation steps

Describe the best method(s) to mitigate the finding.

To prevent unauthorized minting, implement **strict access control**:

**Restrict `_credit` to only authorized entities:**
   ```solidity
   function _credit(
       address _to,
       uint256 _amountLD,
       uint32 /*_srcEid*/
   ) internal virtual override onlyAuthorized returns (uint256 amountReceivedLD) {
   ```
   Where `onlyAuthorized` ensures that only trusted contracts or addresses can invoke this function.
